Today we're releasing Kanchiâ€”a monitoring system for Celery that actually feels good to use. If you've spent years squinting at logs or refreshing Flower tabs, this one's for you.

## Why we built this

Distributed task queues are critical infrastructure, but most observability tools haven't kept up. We wanted something that feels fun to use while providing deep insights into task execution.

Kanchi connects directly to your message broker (no agents, no SDK changes) and gives you real-time visibility into what's actually happening. Tasks, workers, retries, failuresâ€”everything you need to debug issues and prevent outages.

## What you get

### Live task monitoring
WebSocket-based updates mean you see tasks as they flow through your system. No refresh button, no polling lag. Switch between streaming mode for active debugging and paginated views for historical analysis.

Each task shows the full context: arguments, results, execution time, and stack traces. If a task retries, you'll see the entire chain with parent-child relationships mapped out.

### Search and filter that actually works
Date range picker with calendar support. Filter by status, task name, worker, queueâ€”or combine them all. Full-text search across task arguments and results. The interface updates in real time as you refine queries.

### Worker health at a glance
Live worker status with heartbeat tracking. See which workers are handling the most load, which ones are idle, and which ones disappeared mid-task. The dashboard updates as workers join or leave the pool.

### Task registry
Browse every registered Celery task in your application. Multi-environment support means you can monitor prod, staging, and dev separately without mixing state.

### Orphan detection
When tasks fail because a worker crashed or the network dropped, Kanchi flags them automatically. Bulk retry with batch tracking so you can recover gracefully instead of scrambling through logs.

### Persistence without the pain
SQLite by default, PostgreSQL for production. Task history with full state transitions, daily statistics, trend analysis. Auto-migrations with Alembicâ€”zero manual schema work.
