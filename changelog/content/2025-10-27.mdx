We've been shipping fast since v1.0.0. This release brings intelligent automation, safer deployments, and the kind of polish that comes from actually using the thing every day.

## Workflow Engine

The headline feature: automated response to task failures. If you've ever manually retried a batch of failed tasks at 2am or wished Slack would just tell you when things break, this is for you.

### Event-driven automation
Create workflows that trigger on specific conditions—task failures, orphan detection, execution time thresholds. Each workflow runs independently with full execution history and rollback support.

### Circuit breaker protection
Workflows include configurable circuit breakers to prevent infinite retry loops. Set thresholds for execution count and time windows. When limits are hit, the circuit opens and notifications are sent instead of blindly retrying tasks into oblivion.

### Slack integration
Native Slack action for workflow notifications. Configure webhook URLs, customize message templates with task context variables, and get alerted when automation kicks in or circuits trip. Supports multiple webhook configurations per workflow.

### Retry orchestration
Built-in retry action with configurable delays, max attempts, and exponential backoff. Workflows can automatically retry failed tasks with the same arguments, track retry chains across parent-child relationships, and stop gracefully when manual intervention is needed.

### Workflow catalog
Browse and clone pre-built workflow templates for common scenarios: auto-retry on transient failures, Slack alerts for critical task types, orphan task recovery. Each template includes sensible defaults and inline documentation.

## Task Detail Pages

Click any task to see everything: full argument inspection, result payloads, stack traces with syntax highlighting, retry chain visualization, and execution timeline. Deep-linkable URLs mean you can share specific task failures with your team without writing a novel in Slack.

## Failed Task Dashboard

Unified view of both failed tasks and orphans on the home page. Real-time counters, filterable lists, bulk retry controls. The interface automatically refreshes as new failures come in via WebSocket.

Orphan tasks now show their last-known worker and estimated abandonment time. Failed tasks display error messages inline so you can triage without clicking through.

## Deployment Improvements

### Docker Compose workflow
We modeled the deployment experience after Docmost—download a single `docker-compose.yaml`, set `RABBITMQ_URL`, run one command. No configuration sprawl, no vendor lock-in. Bring your own RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getkanchi/kanchi/main/docker-compose.yaml
# Configure in docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d --build --pull always --force-recreate
```

The same command handles both initial deployment and updates. Pull new code, re-run the command, you're done.

### Better database support
SQLite still works great for development and small deployments. For production, point `DATABASE_URL` at PostgreSQL and migrations run automatically on startup. No manual Alembic commands, no schema drift.

## Quality of Life

**Pagination fix**
The select dropdown for page limits now correctly shows your current selection instead of always displaying the default. Small thing, but it was annoying.

**SQL dialect detection**
Timeline queries now use the correct SQL dialect based on your configured database. No more SQLite-specific syntax breaking PostgreSQL deployments.

**Cleaner codebase**
Removed unused keybindings that were triggering accidentally. Added comprehensive test coverage for workflow circuit breakers, retry limits, and infinite loop prevention. Tests run in CI and locally via `./run_tests.sh`.

## What's Next

This release focused on automation and stability. Now that the foundation is solid, we're shifting focus to the details that make software feel good to use—refined interactions, thoughtful design decisions, and the kind of polish that comes from sweating the small stuff ✨.

If you're upgrading from v1.0.0, database migrations run automatically. Existing orphan batch and retry logic remains unchanged—workflows are opt-in automation on top of the existing foundation.
