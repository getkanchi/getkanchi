If you upgraded to v1.2.0 and ran into database migration issues, this patch fixes that.

## What was broken

The workflow circuit breaker migration wasn't properly sequenced with earlier migrations. In some deployment scenarios, this could cause the migration to run out of order or fail entirely.

## What's fixed

Migrations now run in the correct sequence. If you experienced issues upgrading to v1.2.0, pull the latest version and the database will migrate cleanly.

Standard upgrade process appliesâ€”pull the update and restart. Database migrations run automatically on startup.
