title: "MySQL support and pickle opt-in"
description: "Health probes move to /api/health, optional pickle payloads, and clearer version visibility"
date: "2025-11-15"
version: "1.3.2"

Steady refinements focused on compatibility and operational clarity.

## What's new

**MySQL deployments are now supported**
Kanchi now bundles a compatible MySQL driver so MySQL stacks start cleanly and run with first-class support.

**Optional pickle serialization**
Celery payloads remain JSON-first, but you can opt in to pickle by setting `ENABLE_PICKLE_SERIALIZATION=true`. When enabled, Kanchi accepts `application/x-python-serialize` and logs a startup warning to flag the risk.

## Improvements

**Health probes use `/api/health`**
The healthcheck endpoint moved for consistency. Update liveness/readiness probes and scripts from `/health` to `/api/health`.

**Version visibility**
The running app version is now exposed in the UI and API responses to speed up support and troubleshooting.

**Safer event logging**
`_json_safe` now understands Enum values so event logs stay stable instead of failing on uncommon payloads.

Upgrade as usual: pull the latest image or code, apply your environment variables, and restart the services.
