Smoother task browsing and more resilient live updates.

## What's new

**TaskLatestDB snapshot**
A new snapshot table and service logic accelerate task queries and sorting so large queues stay responsive.

**Live event handling**
WebSocket broadcasts now preserve task args/kwargs correctly, keeping live views accurate.

**UI and docs**
The main content area gets a small layout tweak for wider screens, and the README now includes a “Getting Help” section with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kH42uYWb) invite.
