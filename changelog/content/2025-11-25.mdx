Focused on database correctness and easier cluster rollouts.

## What's new

**MySQL-friendly task handling**
Task service inserts now work cleanly on MySQL and normalize timestamps to UTC so event comparisons stay consistent across databases.

**Kubernetes starter kit**
First-pass manifests for deployments, ingress, PVC, secrets, and services, along with a deployment guide and MySQL config example, to simplify getting Kanchi running in a cluster.

Standard upgrade: pull the latest image or code, apply your environment variables, and restart. Database migrations run automatically if needed.
