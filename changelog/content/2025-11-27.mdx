Observability gets a boost and task cleanup gets easier.

## What's new

**Prometheus metrics**
A dedicated metrics router now exposes task and worker event metrics via the Prometheus client, ready to plug into your existing monitoring. See the [Prometheus metrics guide](/docs/core/prometheus-metrics) for scrape setup and metric names.

**Manual task resolution**
New database model, API routes, service methods, and UI controls let you resolve or unresolve tasks by hand. Resolution status now surfaces across dashboards and task detail views.
