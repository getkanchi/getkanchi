This release makes issue tracking configurable and polishes the interface.

## What's new

**Configurable issue lookback**
Task issue summaries now respect an App Setting for lookback hours, backed by new models, service logic, API routes, and tests. The UI adds a lookback selector, smarter titles, and an option to hide resolved tasks so you can focus on what’s noisy right now.

**UI refresh**
We changed the default typeface, data tables pick up dynamic columns and smoother transitions, task detail sections are reorganized, and nav links generate automatically. The “Raw Task Data” section now carries a disclaimer, plus clearer copy and worker status tweaks.
