Kanchi monitors your Celery tasks by connecting to your broker and result backend. Most Celery configurations work out of the box, but some settings can improve your monitoring experience.

## Task argument size limits

Celery truncates task arguments and keyword arguments at 1024 characters by default when storing task representations. If you're working with large payloads — like passing JSON blobs or file contents as task arguments — you'll see `...` in Kanchi's task detail view instead of the full data.

This is a Celery limitation, not a Kanchi one. The good news: it's configurable.

### Increasing the limits

Override Celery's defaults on your app instance:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('your_app')

# Increase representation limits (default: 1024)
app.amqp.argsrepr_maxsize = 10000
app.amqp.kwargsrepr_maxsize = 10000
```

<Callout type="warn">
**Performance consideration**: Larger limits mean more data stored in your broker and database. If you're passing multi-megabyte arguments, consider storing them elsewhere (S3, Redis, etc.) and passing references instead.
</Callout>

**When to adjust these values**:
- Task detail pages show truncated arguments (`...`)
- You need full argument inspection for debugging
- Your tasks legitimately require large payloads

**Reference**: See Celery's [`argsrepr_maxsize` documentation](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/reference/celery.app.amqp.html#celery.app.amqp.AMQP.argsrepr_maxsize) for more details.
