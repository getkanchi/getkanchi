## What are Orphaned Tasks?

An orphaned task occurs when a Celery worker crashes or is terminated while executing a task. The task remains in a "running" state indefinitely, but will never complete because the worker is gone.

## The Problem

Without orphan detection:
- Tasks stuck in "running" state forever
- No automatic recovery mechanism
- Manual intervention required to identify and retry
- Loss of visibility into task failures

## How Kanchi Solves This

Kanchi is the **only Celery monitoring tool** with automatic orphan detection built-in.

### Detection Algorithm

1. **Worker Heartbeat Monitoring**
   - Tracks worker online/offline events
   - Maintains real-time worker status

2. **Task State Tracking**
   - Monitors all running tasks per worker
   - Cross-references with worker health

3. **Grace Period**
   - Waits for late-arriving completion events
   - Configurable timeout (default: 60 seconds)

4. **Automatic Marking**
   - Tasks marked as orphaned when worker goes offline
   - Visual indicators in the dashboard

## Features

### Automatic Detection

Tasks are automatically detected as orphaned when:
- Worker goes offline while task is running
- No completion event received within grace period
- Worker fails to send heartbeats

```python
# No code changes needed!
# Kanchi automatically detects orphaned tasks
```

### One-Click Retry

Retry orphaned tasks with original parameters:

- Original arguments and kwargs preserved
- Retry chain tracking
- Visual parent to child relationships

### Retry Chain Visualization

See the full retry hierarchy:

```
original_task (orphaned)
  └─> retry_1 (succeeded)
```

## Dashboard Views

### Orphaned Tasks View

Filter to see only orphaned tasks with clear visual indicators showing:

- **Status Badge**: Clear "ORPHANED" indicator
- **Worker Info**: Which worker was running the task
- **Retry Button**: One-click retry
- **Original Args**: View original parameters

## Workflow Automation

Automate orphan recovery with workflow rules:

```yaml
# Automatic retry for orphaned tasks
rule:
  name: "Auto-retry orphaned critical tasks"
  trigger:
    event: "task.orphaned"
    filters:
      - field: "task.name"
        operator: "contains"
        value: "critical"
  actions:
    - type: "retry"
      delay: 60  # Wait 1 minute before retry
```

## API Access

Query orphaned tasks via API:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/tasks?status=orphaned"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "abc-123",
      "name": "process_data",
      "status": "orphaned",
      "worker": "worker-1",
      "orphaned_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "can_retry": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Statistics

Track orphan rates over time:

- Daily orphan count
- Orphan rate by task type
- Worker failure patterns
- Recovery success rate

## Best Practices

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate grace periods">
    Balance between quick detection and avoiding false positives:
    - Fast tasks: 30-60 seconds
    - Long-running tasks: 2-5 minutes
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor worker health">
    Prevent orphans by maintaining healthy workers:
    - Set up proper monitoring
    - Use health checks
    - Implement graceful shutdown
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automate recovery">
    Use workflow automation for critical tasks:
    - Auto-retry important tasks
    - Send alerts for failures
    - Track retry success rates
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Limitations

<Callout type="warn">
Orphan detection requires workers to send events. Ensure `worker_send_task_events` is enabled in your Celery configuration.
</Callout>

```python
# Enable task events
app.conf.worker_send_task_events = True
app.conf.task_send_sent_event = True
```
