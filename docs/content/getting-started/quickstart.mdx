Get Kanchi running alongside your Celery workers in minutes. This guide assumes you already have a message broker (RabbitMQ or Redis) running.

<Callout type="warn">
**Prerequisites**: You need a running message broker that your Celery workers are connected to. Kanchi monitors task events from this broker â€” it doesn't manage broker infrastructure for you.
</Callout>

## Quick start with Docker

The fastest way to run Kanchi is with Docker:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Download the Docker Compose file**

    ```bash
    mkdir kanchi && cd kanchi
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getkanchi/kanchi/main/docker-compose.yaml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Configure your broker connection**

    Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and set your broker URL:

    <Tabs items={['RabbitMQ', 'Redis']} className="border-gray-800 [&_[role=tab]:hover]:text-white">
      <Tab value="rabbitmq">
        ```yaml
        environment:
          CELERY_BROKER_URL: amqp://user:password@rabbitmq-host:5672//
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="redis">
        ```yaml
        environment:
          CELERY_BROKER_URL: redis://redis-host:6379/0
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Start Kanchi**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

    Access the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Verify the connection**

    Check the logs to confirm Kanchi connected to your broker:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f kanchi
    ```

    You should see: `Connected to broker` in the output.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
The same `docker compose up` command handles both initial deployment and updates. Pull new code, re-run the command, you're done.
</Callout>

## Local development setup

If you're developing Kanchi or want to run it without Docker:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Install dependencies**

    You'll need:
    - Python 3.8+ with Poetry
    - Node.js 20+ with npm
    - A running message broker (RabbitMQ or Redis)

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/getkanchi/kanchi.git
    cd kanchi

    # Backend dependencies
    cd agent
    poetry install

    # Frontend dependencies
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Configure environment variables**

    Create a `.env` file or export variables:

    ```bash
    # Required: broker connection
    export CELERY_BROKER_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//

    # Optional: database (defaults to SQLite)
    export DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///kanchi.db

    # Optional: API URLs for frontend
    export NUXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8765
    export NUXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8765/ws
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Start the application**

    From the project root:

    ```bash
    make dev
    ```

    This starts both the FastAPI backend (port 8765) and Nuxt frontend (port 3000).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Access the dashboard**

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generate test tasks

If you want to see Kanchi in action without a production workload, use the included test environment:

```bash
cd scripts/test-celery-app

# Start RabbitMQ, Redis, and test Celery workers
make start

# Generate mixed task load (success, failures, retries)
make test-mixed

# Generate only successful tasks
make test-success

# Generate only failing tasks
make test-failure

# Stop test environment
make stop
```

Tasks will appear in the Kanchi dashboard in real-time as they execute.

## Verify your setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Check backend health**

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8765/api/health
    ```

    You should get a `200 OK` response.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Verify broker connection**

    Check application logs for "Connected to broker" messages:

    <Tabs items={['Local', 'Docker']} className="border-gray-800 [&_[role=tab]:hover]:text-white">
      <Tab value="local">
        ```bash
        tail -f kanchi.log
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="docker">
        ```bash
        docker compose logs -f kanchi
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    **Run a test task**

    Execute a task from your Celery application. It should appear in the Kanchi dashboard within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="No tasks appearing in dashboard" value="no-tasks">
    **Check broker connection**: Verify that `CELERY_BROKER_URL` matches the broker your Celery workers are using. Kanchi and your workers must connect to the **same broker instance**.

    **Enable event broadcasting**: Ensure your Celery workers have events enabled:

    ```python
    # In your Celery config
    worker_send_task_events = True
    task_send_sent_event = True
    ```

    Or start workers with the `-E` flag:

    ```bash
    celery -A your_app worker -E
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection refused errors" value="connection-refused">
    **Check broker accessibility**: Ensure your message broker is running and accessible from where Kanchi is running.

    For Docker deployments, use the broker's container name or IP address, not `localhost`.

    **Firewall rules**: Verify that firewall rules allow connections to the broker port (5672 for RabbitMQ, 6379 for Redis).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frontend can't connect to backend" value="frontend-connection">
    **Check API URLs**: Verify `NUXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NUXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` point to your backend.

    **CORS issues**: If running backend and frontend on different hosts, configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:

    ```bash
    export ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://your-frontend-domain.com
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
