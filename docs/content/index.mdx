# Kanchi Documentation

Real-time monitoring for Celery that actually feels good to use. If you've spent years squinting at logs or refreshing Flower tabs, this one's for you.

## What Kanchi does

Kanchi connects directly to your message broker — no agents, no SDK changes — and gives you real-time visibility into task execution. Tasks, workers, retries, failures, everything you need to debug issues and prevent outages.

**Live task monitoring**
WebSocket-based updates mean you see tasks as they flow through your system. No refresh button, no polling lag. Switch between streaming mode for active debugging and paginated views for historical analysis.

**Orphan detection**
When tasks fail because a worker crashed or the network dropped, Kanchi flags them automatically. Bulk retry with batch tracking so you can recover gracefully instead of scrambling through logs.

**Workflow automation**
Event-driven actions that respond to task failures without writing code. Circuit breaker protection prevents infinite retry loops. Slack integration for notifications. Pre-built templates for common scenarios.

**Worker health at a glance**
Live worker status with heartbeat tracking. See which workers are handling the most load, which ones are idle, and which ones disappeared mid-task.

## Quick start

Get Kanchi running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Download Docker Compose file

## Key features

### Real-time monitoring
WebSocket-powered updates. See tasks as they execute. Multi-dimensional filtering: status, date range, task name, worker, queue. Full-text search across task arguments and results.

### Task management
Detailed retry tracking with parent-child task relationships. Complete state transition history. Deep-linkable URLs for sharing specific task failures with your team.

### Orphan detection
Automatic identification of tasks that started but never completed. One-click bulk retry with batch tracking. Orphan recovery workflows that run automatically.

### Workflow automation
Event-driven responses to task failures. Circuit breakers to prevent infinite retry loops. Slack integration for notifications. Pre-built templates for common scenarios.

### Worker health
Live status with heartbeat tracking. Task distribution metrics. Queue assignments for each worker. Automatic detection of offline workers.

### Analytics
Daily task statistics aggregated by status. Historical trend analysis. Worker utilization metrics. Task failure rate tracking.

<Callout>
Kanchi is **broker-agnostic**. Works with both RabbitMQ and Redis message brokers. Pick whichever fits your stack.
