## What is Kanchi?

Kanchi is a production-ready monitoring system for Celery distributed task queues. It provides real-time visibility into task execution, automatic detection and recovery of orphaned tasks, worker health monitoring, and event-driven workflow automationâ€”all through a modern web interface with WebSocket-powered live updates.

## The Problem

Celery provides minimal built-in monitoring, making it difficult to:
- Debug failures and track task lifecycle
- Detect orphaned tasks when workers crash
- Automate recovery workflows
- Get real-time visibility into your task queue

## The Solution

Kanchi captures all Celery events and provides:
- **Real-time dashboard** with full task history
- **Automatic orphan detection** with one-click retry
- **Workflow automation** without code changes
- **Worker health monitoring** with system metrics
- **Advanced analytics** and trend analysis
